class AbstractConnection(ABC, torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Abstract class for implementing connections.

    Make sure to implement the `compute`, `update`, and `reset_state_variables`\
    methods in your child class.

    You will need to define the populations you want to connect as `pre` and `post`.\
    In case of learning, you will need to define the learning rate (`lr`) and the \
    learning rule to follow. Attribute `w` is reserved for synaptic weights.\
    However, it has not been predefined or allocated, as it depends on the \
    pattern of connectivity. So make sure to define it in child class initializations \
    appropriately to indicate the pattern of connectivity. The default range of \
    each synaptic weight is [0, 1] but it can be controlled by `wmin` and `wmax`. \
    Synaptic strengths might decay in time and do not last forever. To define \
    the decay rate of the synaptic weights, use `weight_decay` attribute. Also, \
    if you want to control the overall input synaptic strength to each neuron, \
    use `norm` argument to normalize the synaptic weights.

    In case of learning, you have to implement the methods `compute` and `update`. \
    You will use the `compute` method to calculate the activity of post-synaptic \
    population based on the pre-synaptic one. Update of weights based on the \
    learning rule will be implemented in the `update` method. If you find this \
    architecture mind-bugling, try your own architecture and make sure to redefine \
    the learning rule architecture to be compatible with this new architecture \
    of yours.

    Arguments
    ---------
    pre : NeuralPopulation
        The pre-synaptic neural population.
    post : NeuralPopulation
        The post-synaptic neural population.
    lr : float or (float, float), Optional
        The learning rate for training procedure. If a tuple is given, the first
        value defines potentiation learning rate and the second one depicts\
        the depression learning rate. The default is None.
    weight_decay : float, Optional
        Define rate of decay in synaptic strength. The default is 0.0.

    Keyword Arguments
    -----------------
    learning_rule : LearningRule
        Define the learning rule by which the network will be trained. The\
        default is NoOp (see learning/learning_rules.py for more details).
    wmin : float
        The minimum possible synaptic strength. The default is 0.0.
    wmax : float
        The maximum possible synaptic strength. The default is 1.0.
    norm : float
        Define a normalization on input signals to a population. If `None`,\
        there is no normalization. The default is None.
